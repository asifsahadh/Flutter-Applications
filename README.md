# Flutter-Applications

<p align = "justify"> This repository contains a few of my initial works in Flutter. I am still a beginner, learning this framework under the guidance of one of my professors, who recommended Flutter for integrating AI solutions with mobile applications. </p>

<p align = "justify"> These projects are simple and exploratory, and I am still in the process of familiarizing myself with the syntax (I tend to be quite forgetful of it).  My plan is to learn this framework thoroughly enough to integrate AI-powered solutions into mobile applications. </p>
